# Meridian stress harness

In-process stress harness that ingests the **Meridian** PDF corpus through the real
pipeline (classify → index → extract → resolve → link), relinks, scores it against the
oracle in `fixtures/meridian/labels.json`, runs the graph-integrity checks, and writes a
20-row pass/fail matrix to `stress-report.md`.

It reuses the live eval scorers (`test/eval/scorers.ts`) and the pure report/matrix module
(`scripts/stress/meridian-report.ts`). Nothing in `lib/` or `app/` is mocked — the scorers
read the real graph.

## Prerequisites

1. **Postgres + pgvector** running locally on port **5433** with the schema migrated
   (the project's Docker pgvector container; bring it up and run migrations as usual).
2. **`.env`** at the repo root with:
   - `DATABASE_URL` — pointing at the local DB on 5433
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — extraction/classification LLM calls
   - `VOYAGE_API_KEY` — embeddings
3. **Generate the Meridian PDFs first** (renders `fixtures/meridian/src/*.md` → `fixtures/meridian/pdf/*.pdf`):

   ```bash
   pnpm stress:pdfs
   ```

---

## Running the stress test (local)

```bash
MERIDIAN=live pnpm stress:run
```

This will:

1. `TRUNCATE` all knowledge/substrate tables in the target DB (restarting identities).
2. Ingest every `fixtures/meridian/pdf/*.pdf` through the pipeline.
3. `relinkAll()`, then score classification / extraction / resolution / linking / links / CQ.
4. Run integrity (provenance span localisation + polymorphic edge-endpoint integrity).
5. Build the 20-row matrix and write `stress-report.md` (also echoed to stdout).

**Exit code:** `0` if every matrix row passes, non-zero if any row fails.

### Guard (no env var)

Running `pnpm stress:run` **without** `MERIDIAN=live` prints a skip notice and exits `0`
**without touching the DB**. The live run is only entered when `MERIDIAN=live` is set.

---

## Reading `stress-report.md`

The report has three parts:

- **Headline** — one line: CQ `passed/total`, in-domain docs ready, matrix `passing/total`,
  and integrity counts (`spanViolations`, `endpointViolations`, `apCount`, `activeEdgeCount`).
- **Matrix table** — the 20 stress scenarios (`# | scenario | result | detail`). `PASS`/`FAIL`
  per row; the `detail` column shows the underlying numbers so a failure is self-explaining.
- **Scorecard** — the full eval scorecard (classification accuracy, extraction/field/resolution
  P/R/F1, entity-linking accuracy, link P/R sweep + chosen threshold, per-CQ pass/fail).

An all-green run shows the 17 in-domain docs `ready`, `marketing-brief.pdf` `unrouted`,
CQ `10/10`, `0` span/endpoint violations, and **all 20 matrix rows PASS**.

### When a row fails

Failures are **findings about the corpus/oracle**, not the product. Adjust the relevant
`fixtures/meridian/src/*.md` (then re-run `pnpm stress:pdfs`) or correct an oracle derivation
in `fixtures/meridian/labels.json`, and re-run. A row that flaps run-to-run is LLM
nondeterminism — re-run before treating it as a finding. **Do not** change `lib/` or `app/`
to make a row pass.

## Promote to production (manual, user-confirmed)

Promotion seeds the **production** database with the Meridian graph so the deployed app
serves it. This is a **manual, user-confirmed** step — it truncates the prod DB.

1. Point `DATABASE_URL` at the production DB (the Vercel/Neon connection string).
2. Run:

   ```bash
   STRESS_CONFIRM=yes MERIDIAN=live pnpm stress:run
   ```

`STRESS_CONFIRM=yes` is **required** when the target host looks like a managed/prod database
(matches `neon`/`vercel`/`amazonaws`/`supabase`); without it the harness refuses and exits
non-zero. With it set, the harness **truncates the prod DB**, re-ingests the Meridian corpus,
and the deployed app then serves the freshly-built Meridian graph.

Treat this as a deliberate, one-off operation — confirm the target host (the harness echoes a
password-masked `target DB:` line) before proceeding.

Get the prod connection string from Neon (use the **direct**, non-pooled endpoint — the
harness opens prepared-statement connections that the PgBouncer pooled endpoint can reject):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=$(neonctl connection-string production --project-id <id> --org-id <id> \
  --database-name neondb --role-name neondb_owner)
STRESS_CONFIRM=yes MERIDIAN=live DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" pnpm stress:run
```

## Verify the live deployment (1:1)

After promoting, confirm the **deployed Vercel app** serves the graph identically to the local
result. `verify-live.ts` drives the real HTTP surface — `POST /api/query` for all 10 CQs,
`GET /api/status`, and `POST /api/ask` probes — against the live URL and compares every
deterministic answer to the oracle. Entity IDs restart on each rebuild, so it resolves them by
label from the same Neon DB the app reads.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL" STRATA_URL=https://strata-eight-green.vercel.app pnpm stress:verify-live
```

Exit `0` iff every gated row (status + 10 CQs) passes. The `ask` rows are informational — the
ask path narrates the *same* deterministic rowset, so its correctness follows from the CQ rows;
the probes just confirm the live router + narration respond sensibly.
